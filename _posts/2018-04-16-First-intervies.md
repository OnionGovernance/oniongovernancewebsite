title: First Interviews
---
First round of interviews launched! This week, we have been starting with the first round of interviews. We are looking forward to learning more about our research topic from our interview partners. As soon as we have sufficient information, a preliminary report (of course, with de-personalized data) will be published. This report will most likely also take the form of a blog post, so you'll be able to find it right here when it appears.

If you would like to be a part of these initial discussions, don't hesitate to send us a message!
