# What is this project?
In the broader public debate, the dark net is usually demonized as a trafficking platform and occasionally praised as a free haven for whistleblowers and dissidents from authoritarian regimes. The highly normative debate, however, tends to obfuscate another characteristic which might be even more interesting: Transactions within the dark net are comparably safe. It seems fair to say that the dark net is a space in which property rights are defined and enforced without and often against the will of state authorities.

In this project, we take this observation as a starting point. We conceptualize the dark net as a digital space which is occupied by a growing number of social groups with more or less specialized purposes. From this perspective, we ask ourselves how the emerging social order of the dark net can be characterized. Is it an agglomeration of marketplaces for the transaction of (illegal) goods? Is there an overarching code of behavior between these markets, which might be comparable to the merchantsâ€™ law of the late middle ages? Or are we witnessing the formation of a more complex social order, maybe even a cluster of proto-states in the making?

# Our approach to this question 
Currently, we are starting with a short pilot study which will be extended over the coming years (probably, until 2025). To gain insight on the questions posed above, we are conducting online interviews with forum providers, administrators, and users using the following set of questions.

1.	Please describe your main activities and tasks in this forum.
2.	What are your main motivations to be active in this forum?
3.	How would you describe your relationship with other participants of your forum (hosts, administrators, clients, escrows)?
4.	Are there any formal or informal rules how to behave within your forum? If so, how would you describe them?
5.	Did you ever experience any conflicts within your forum? And if so, how have these conflicts been resolved?
6.	How would you describe your relationship with the participants (hosts, administrators, users, escrows) of other forums?
7.	Are there any formal or informal rules which apply for interactions between different forums? And if so, how would you describe them?
8.	Did you ever experience any conflicts between different forums? And if so, how have these conflicts been resolved?
9.	How would you describe the potentials and threats for the dark net as a whole?
10.	To what extent do you think that the users of the dark net are able to react to these potentials and threats?


We are interested in general perceptions and norms, but we will never ask for any individual transactions. Moreover, we do not question the moral attitudes of our respondents, because we perceive ourselves as mere observers of the social dynamics.
