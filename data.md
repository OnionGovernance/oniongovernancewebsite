# How do we handle data?
The results of our email and chat interviews will only be stored on encrypted media/devices. We will make sure that the data is only accessible to the research team, with the exception of possible academic integrity checks by an audit or ethics committee, which are also bound to confidentiality restrictions.

When publishing our results, all data will be depersonalized. We will ensure that our publications do not allow the backtracking of individual respondents nor will we communicate any personal data to interested third parties.
